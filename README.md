    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  (Modify prior projects.)  
    Copy directories and sample files from prior project (or create from scratch)
    -- Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzipping likely fastest method.     
    -- Could not find a quicker way to copy over all files.    
    ... create HTML and CSS ...
