==============================================================================================================================   
Github:  
    Create Repo (github, repositories => New)  
    Clone to local machine (Copy https, then git clone paste)  
    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  (Modify prior projects.)  
    Copy directories and sample files from prior project (or create from scratch)
    -- Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzipping likely fastest method.     
    -- Could not find a quicker way to copy over all files.    
    ... create HTML and CSS ...  
    Commit and push files back to gitHub  
    Deploy code (Settings ... CA on left, GitHub Pages->main)  
        - Deployed code name on the right - maybe!!
    Make Sure it Works  
    Insert Screenshot of deployment into readme file.  
  
HTML, CSS and Javascript  
    View the Acceptance Criteria.  - Fuzzy as usual, especially in regards to showScores,
